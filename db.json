monumental task of conducting their second national forest inventory (NFI). In an attempt to expedite the process, Co-founder of Sustainability Tech—Sebastian Persch—joined the Forest Carbon team and was tasked with developing scripts for the inventory data analyses, which would cut costs and save time.</p>\n\nHaving data collected in the field using tablets and uploading directly to a database presented a novel opportunity that Sebastian realized could further improve efficiency. Why not have real time analysis that feeds straight back to the project managers. With this in mind Sebastian developed the perfect monitoring tool keep track of what is going on in the field. The ability to detect measurement errors and outliers on the fly proved to be a real asset to the project managers who could then alert field teams and send them back to take new measurements whilst they are still in the area. Coupled with the applications functions—automatic generation of up to date maps, graphs and relevant project information—the app quickly became an indispensable tool for both project managers and people on the ground.\n\nThe first iteration of what would become a Sustainability Tech was born…\n\nA few months later Sebastian's wife Meri was working on the development of the Social Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) for smallholder oil palm farmers.
