SEBASTIAN PERSCH

Co-FOUNDER

Sebastian strongly believes that recent technological advances should and needs to be made available for practitioners of sustainable practices—in particular smallholder farmers— in order to make the entry into sustainable certification easier, more transparent and less costly. Without technological innovation in these areas, truly sustainable tropical landscapes will remain out of reach.

With an experience of over 7 years of research in tropical peatlands, oil palm production, climate change mitigation, consulting on advanced data analysis and statistical programming for forest conservation projects across Southeast Asia, Sebastian understands the complexity of tropical landscapes and thus sees the need for improvement for smallholder certification schemes across agricultural commodities.
JOSH VAN VIANEN

Co-FOUNDER

Josh strongly believes in the potential of technological solutions to engender equitable, transparent and sustainable landscapes. Through providing simple and knowledge driven applications, better engaged stakeholder communities can be empowered to contribute towards higher sustainability standards and certifications for the benefit of both local people and the environment.   

With an academic background in ecology and biodiversity conservation, and more recent academic pursuits researching integrated landscape approaches in the tropics, Josh brings with him a unique set of skills, ideas and experiences required to build integrated and multi-faceted systems for making positive change in complex forested landscapes of global social and ecological importance.
