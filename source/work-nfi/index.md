A National Forest Inventory (NFI) is a periodically conducted survey on state of the forests in a particular country. The NFI of the People's Republic of Lao was done once in 1996 and during the last years (2015 - 2017) for the second time. Forest Carbon created a digital survey (in a same manner the SEIA survey is designed), and Sebastian was asked to help automate the data analysis and subsequently design a web-app. You can try the app below, but note that the data are NOT the original data, but some made-up values to showcase the capacity of the app.

App

The app takes the data from the survey and shows the progress of the NFI sampling, computes means and different kinds of errors that are presented as tables, and shows the sampling plots on a map. Note that this is not the full version of the app and that the data are not the originally collected values. Give it a try below!
