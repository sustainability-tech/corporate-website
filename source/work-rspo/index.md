To obtain RSPO certification oil palm smallholders groups need to conduct of a simplified SEIA (Social and Environmental Impact Assessment). To make it easier, less time consuming and thus cheaper for the smallholder group, this smallholder-friendly SEIA tool has been developed. We also translated the tool into Thai and Indonesian, and the languages can be changed simply by a click on a button!

This tool consists of 2 parts, i.e. a survey to assess the potential social and environmental impact of the smallholder group, and an app to automatically generate the SEIA report and a SEIA management plan.
